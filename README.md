# sqlpkg-ruby

[sqlpkg](https://sqlpkg.org/) is the (unofficial) SQLite package registry. This gem provides a Ruby interface to [its CLI](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlpkg-cli).

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:
```shell
bundle add sqlpkg
```

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:
```shell
gem install sqlpkg
```

After installing the gem, run the installer:
```shell
rails generate sqlpkg:install
```

The installer does three things:

1. creates an empty `.sqlpkg/` directory, which ensures that `sqlpkg` will run in "project scope" and not "global scope" (see [the `sqlpkg-cli` README](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlpkg-cli#project-vs-global-scope) for more information)
2. creates an empty `sqlpkg.lock` file, which `sqlpkg` will use to store information about the installed packages (see [the `sqlpkg-cli` README](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlpkg-cli#lockfile) for more information)
3. creates an initializer file at `config/initializers/sqlpkg.rb` which will patch the `SQLite3Adapter` to automatically load the extensions installed in the `.sqlpkg/` directory whenever the database is opened

Once properly integrated into your Rails application, you can install any extension listed on [the `sqlpkg` registry](https://sqlpkg.org/all/) by executing:
```shell
bundle exec sqlpkg install PACKAGE_IDENTIFIER
```

When exploring the [the `sqlpkg` registry](https://sqlpkg.org/all/), the `PACKAGE_IDENTIFIER` needed to install an extension is the title found in the cards, always in `owner/name` format.

This gem wraps the standalone executable version of the [sqlpkg-cli](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlpkg-cli#download-and-install-preferred-method). These executables are platform specific, so there are actually separate underlying gems per platform, but the correct gem will automatically be picked for your platform.

Supported platforms are:

* arm64-darwin (macos-arm64)
* x86_64-darwin (macos-x64)
* arm64-linux (linux-arm64)
* x86_64-linux (linux-x64)

### Using a local installation of `sqlpkg`

If you are not able to use the vendored standalone executables (for example, if you're on an unsupported platform), you can use a local installation of the `sqlpkg` executable by setting an environment variable named `SQLPKG_INSTALL_DIR` to the directory containing the executable.

For example, if you've installed `sqlpkg` so that the executable is found at `/usr/local/bin/sqlpkg`, then you should set your environment variable like so:

``` sh
SQLPKG_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin
```

This also works with relative paths. If you've installed into your app's directory at `./.bin/sqlpkg`:

``` sh
SQLPKG_INSTALL_DIR=.bin
```

## Usage

```shell
bundle exec sqlpkg help

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. For maintainers, to release a new version, run `bin/release $VERSION`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push all of the platform-specific `.gem` files to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
